# MC+ V2

As stated in the main branch README, this step in the automation simply updates Contacts+ everytime a relevant update is made in Mailchimp. 

## **Note:** 
Tag names in Contacts+ should perfectly match the interest categories found in Mailchimp and have to be manually created. These scripts do not automatically
 create tags in Contacts+ to match Mailchimp, so it has to be done manually. The tag names must be exactly matching strings (case- and space- sensitive)!!
